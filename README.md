### An application by Jack Ersbo

This application enables users to view, list, and reserve parking spaces on the property of the respective lister. This is an idea I have had for a while, and originally prompted me to pursue web app development. To use, simply create an account and log in to start reserving spaces. I hope you enjoy!

**Note: This is a non-functional version of the application. More features and functionality will be added in the coming weeks.**

## Utilized tech:

This application features an express.js server with session authentication (cookies), a PostgreSQL database with Sequelize ORM, React.js client with MaterialUI components for styling.

## Features to be added:

Currently, this app does not save spaces to a particular user. This feature will be added soon. In addition, email verification and payment verification will be added.
